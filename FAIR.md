The FAIR principles can not only be applied to data, but can also be applied to software. OBI encourages the adoption of these principles for making software findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable. We like this guide on [making software FAIR](https://fair-software.eu/about/) by the eScience center in the Netherlands.
